# privacy policy

<p><strong>Effective: January 31, 2019</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how pingpong collects, uses and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.</p>
<p>Updates in this version of the Privacy Policy reflect changes in data protection law. In addition, we have worked to make the Privacy Policy clearer and more understandable by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organizing it into the sections listed in the Table of Contents below,</li>
  <li>providing a series of examples that help illustrate how the policies may be implemented by pingpong and</li>
  <li>defining and capitalizing a few terms that are used more than once for simplicity and brevity.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we refer to “<strong>pingpong</strong>”, we mean the pingpong entity that acts as the controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the “Identifying the Data Controller and Processor” section below.</p>

<h2 id="applicability">Applicability Of This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to pingpong’s online workplace productivity tools and platform, including the associated pingpong mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”), usepingpong.com and other pingpong websites (collectively, the “<strong>Websites</strong>”) and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, etc.) you may have with pingpong. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of pingpong’s business.</p>

<p>A separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, “<strong>Customer Data</strong>”). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (“<strong>Customer</strong>”) controls their instance of the Services (their “<strong>Team</strong>”) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Team settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Team you use. If you have an account, you can log in to <a href="http://app.usepingpong.com">https://app.usepingpong.com</a>. If you have received an invitation to join a Team but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.</p>

<h2 id="collect">Information We Collect And Receive</h2>
<p>pingpong may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (“<strong>Other Information</strong>”) in a variety of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer Data</strong>. Customers or individuals granted access to a Team by a Customer (“<strong>Authorized Users</strong>”) routinely submit Customer Data to pingpong when using the Services.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Information.</strong> pingpong also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:    <ol type="I">
      <li>Team and Account Information. To create or update a Team account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer) supply pingpong with an email address, password, Team name and/or similar account details. For details on Team creation, <a href="https://app.usepingpong.com/signup">click here</a>. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide pingpong (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.</li>
      <li>Usage Information.        <ul>
          <li><em>Services Metadata</em>. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way  Authorized Users work. For example, pingpong logs the Teams, courts, people, features, content and links you interact with, the types of files shared and what Third Party Services are used (if any).</li>
          <li><em>Log data</em>. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.</li>
          <li><em>Device information</em>. pingpong collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.</li>
          <li><em>Location information</em>. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. pingpong may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cookie Information. pingpong uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services and across other websites and online services.</li>
      <li>Third Party Services. Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for their Team. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their Team. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with pingpong. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Team, we may receive user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to pingpong to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to pingpong. When a Third Party Service is enabled, pingpong is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to pingpong in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services.</li>
      <li>Contact Information. In accordance with the consent process provided by your device, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import (such as an address book from a device) is collected when using the Services.</li>
      <li>Third Party Data. pingpong may receive data about organizations, industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</li>
      <li>Additional Information Provided to pingpong. We receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with pingpong.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, “<strong>Information</strong>”). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Team setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.</p>
<h2 id="information">How We Use Information</h2>
<p>Customer Data will be used by pingpong in accordance with Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. pingpong is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller. Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to a Team, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.</p>

<p>pingpong uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services, Websites and business. More specifically, pingpong uses Other Information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Websites and business.</strong> This includes use of Other Information to support delivery of the Services under a Customer Agreement, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at an Authorized User’s request.</li>

  <li><strong>To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions.</strong> If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond.</li>
  <li><strong>To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features.</strong> pingpong tries to make the Services as useful as possible for specific Teams and Authorized Users. For example, we may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, courts or expertise to an Authorized User, make Services suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to customize a Services experience or create new productivity features and products.</li>
  <li><strong>To send emails and other communications.</strong> We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about pingpong. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.</li>
  <li><strong>For billing, account management and other administrative matters.</strong> pingpong may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.</li>
  <li><strong>To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, pingpong may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “<strong>Personal Data</strong>.”</p>
<h2 id="retention">Data Retention</h2>
<p>pingpong will retain Customer Data in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. The deletion of Customer Data and other use of the Services by Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain associated Other Information. pingpong may retain Other Information pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This may include keeping your Other Information after you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed for pingpong to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h2 id="disclose">How We Share And Disclose Information</h2>
<p>This section describes how pingpong may share and disclose Information. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information, and pingpong does not control how they or any other third parties choose to share or disclose Information.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer’s Instructions.</strong> pingpong will solely share and disclose Customer Data in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and in compliance with applicable law and legal process.</li>
  <li><strong>Displaying the Services.</strong> When an Authorized User submits Other Information, it may be displayed to other Authorized Users in the same or connected Teams. For example, an Authorized User’s email address may be displayed with their Team profile.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborating with Others.</strong> The Services provide different ways for Authorized Users working in independent Teams to collaborate, such as shared courts. Other Information, such as an Authorized User’s profile Information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the other Team(s).</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Access.</strong> Owners, administrators, Authorized Users and other Customer representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify or restrict access to Other Information. This may include, for example, accessing or modifying your profile details.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Service Providers and Partners.</strong> We may engage third party companies or individuals as service providers or business partners to process Other Information and support our business. These third parties may, for example, provide virtual computing and storage services.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> Customer may enable or permit Authorized Users to enable Third Party Services. When enabled, pingpong may share Other Information with Third Party Services. Third Party Services are not owned or controlled by pingpong and third parties that have been granted access to Other Information may have their own policies and practices for its collection and use. Please check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services or contact the provider for any questions.</li>

  <li><strong>Aggregated or De-identified Data.</strong> We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified Other Information for any purpose. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified Other Information with prospects or partners for business or research purposes, such as telling a prospective pingpong customer the average amount of time spent within a typical Team.</li>
  <li><strong>To Comply with Laws.</strong> If we receive a request for information, we may disclose Other Information if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process.</li>
  <li><strong>To enforce our rights, prevent fraud, and for safety.</strong> To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of pingpong or third parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.</li>
  <li><strong>With Consent.</strong> pingpong may share Other Information with third parties when we have consent to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>pingpong takes security of data very seriously. pingpong works hard to protect Other Information you provide from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the Other Information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology. Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, pingpong cannot guarantee that Information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Age Limitations</h2>
<p>To the extent prohibited by applicable law, pingpong does not allow use of our Services and Websites by anyone younger than 16 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>pingpong may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws, regulations and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make changes to our business.

If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should deactivate your Services account. Contact the Customer if you wish to request the removal of Personal Data under their control.</p>
